# Resume edits to apply in Word (resume.docx)

Use **Find and Replace** (Ctrl+H) in Word and apply these changes. You can do them in any order unless noted.

---

## 1. Fix typo (Kotak project)

- **Find:** zero brok e rage  
- **Replace with:** zero brokerage  

*(If that doesn’t match, try finding “brok” and “e” in two steps and correct the word to “brokerage” by hand.)*

---

## 2. Remove duplicate “Tools” line

In **Technical Skills**, “Tools: Git, GitHub, AWS CLI, Linux, Bash” appears twice. Delete the **second** occurrence (the one that comes after “Core Concepts: Operating System, Computer Network, DBMS”).

---

## 3. Small consistency fixes

- **Find:** Research paper  
- **Replace with:** Research Paper  
  *(only in the “Certification & Research” section)*

- **Find:** AWS :  
- **Replace with:** AWS:  
  *(remove the space before the colon)*

---

## 4. Optional: add location

After your contact line (e.g. after GitHub), you can add:

**Location:** Mohali, Punjab, India  

---

## 5. LinkedIn label (if it’s split)

If “LinkedIn” appears as “Link” and “edIn” on two lines or in two runs, merge them into one word: **LinkedIn**.

After editing, save the document and export to PDF for applications.  
A full cleaned-up version of the resume is in **resume.md** — you can copy it into a new Word document or use it to generate a PDF.
